// Mac Installation Instructions

// 1. Download and unzip the CharTool_mac zipped folder
// 2. Place this folder in the applications folder, otherwise you may have problems opening it.
// 3. CharTool and ImageJ are now installed.

// Description of CharTool Scripts

// In the CharTool_mac folder, there will be only the ImageJ_with_CharTool app. To access the folders for plugins, macros, and other java scripts needed to run ImageJ, right click the app icon and select "show Package Contents. 

// All of the scripts needed to run CharTool are located in three folders once the package contents are revealed. These include: 
// 1. macros/CharTool contains the scripts to run all three CharTool Modules
// 2. macros/CharTool/toolsets contains the code to launch CharTool as a clickable toolset on the ImageJ tool bar.
// 3. plugins/WebcamCapture contains the java scripts needed to connect ImageJ to the live digital microscope feed. This plugin is documented and available for download at https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/webcam-capture/index.html.


// Starting CharTool for the First Time

// 1. Open ImageJ from the CharTool_mac folder by double-clicking on the ImageJ app icon (ImageJ_with_CharTool). 
// 2. Navigate to the ">>" symbol on the far-right side of the toolbar. Click this symbol to reveal the additional menus. 
// 3. Select Launch CharTool from this dropdown list. The CharTool launcher icon will now appear on the menu. 
// 4. Click the CharTool icon to launch CharTool.

//*** NOTE: This suite of macros requires a USB connected video microscope or still images of charcoal slides. 
//*** Additionally, the WebcamCapture seems to no longer be supported on macOS Catalina (version 10.15) or later. A solution for this issue is currently being developed.
