The Charcoal Quantification Tool (CharTool): A suite of open-source tools for quantifying charcoal fragments in archaeological and paleoecological analysis

Version 3.1 (2021)

CharTool is a suite of macro tools for quantifying charcoal fragment metrics and sediment attributes in archaeological, paleoecological, and paleo-fire science contexts. This folder contains ImageJ version 1.52 with CharTool installed for both Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. Please open ImageJ_with_CharTool from the folder that corresponds to your operating system.

Additionally, an Rstudio Project file and an R script are included for processing, visualizing, and preparing CharTool results for upload to the Global PaleoFire Database. 

For questions, please contact Dr. Grant Snitker via email (grant.snitker@uga.edu). 

Please feel welcome to modify the code of any of these modules, but please cite CharTool and ImageJ when using them.
